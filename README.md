Through my internship at PwC Switzerland, I gained a robust skill set in cybersecurity. I developed proficiency in cause analysis, dissecting security incidents to uncover their root causes and bolster resilience against future threats. Firewall configuration skills were honed, allowing me to design and implement robust network defenses. Impact analysis became second nature, enabling me to assess the severity of incidents and prioritize response efforts effectively.

I delved into various aspects of network security, learning to implement encryption, access control, and intrusion detection systems to protect data and resources. Presentation preparation was integral as I learned to communicate complex cybersecurity concepts clearly and persuasively. Principles of defense guided my proactive strategies for preventing and mitigating security breaches.

I gained expertise in risk impact assessment, evaluating the potential consequences of security incidents on business operations and reputation. Understanding risk management frameworks such as NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ISO/IEC 27001 was crucial in effectively assessing and mitigating cybersecurity risks. System security emerged as a core competency, as I implemented security controls to safeguard operating systems, applications, and data from unauthorized access and cyber threats.
